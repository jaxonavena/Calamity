# Calamity
EECS 581 Project

Story:

The main character, DJ, is your average lad who loves to run through dungeons and fight enemies to increase his wealth and loadout. He lives for this. He dies for this. He respawns for this. He doesn't care. DJ loves to battle, and will continue to do so until his Godot project is accidentally deleted.

However, this is his greatest challenge yet, the dungeon of Calamity. No one has ever survived it. Will DJ be able to?


Requires Godot 4.
